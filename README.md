# Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Excursion

Create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” Use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.

The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
